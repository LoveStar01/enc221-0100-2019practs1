            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p>Hello! I'm Loventa Anyango, a student at Jomo Kenyatta University of Agriculture and Technology (JKUAT), studying Geomatic Engineering and Geospatial Information Systems in Juja, Kenya. I’m inspired by the innovative environment around me, which motivates my academic and career goals.</p>
            <p>I love exploring geospatial technology and its uses, like urban planning and environmental conservation. I’m learning advanced techniques and theories to help solve real-world problems.<p>
            <p>Outside of my studies, I enjoy exploring technology and Kenya’s natural beauty. I believe a balanced life with both screen time and outdoor time is important for personal growth.<p>
            <p>Thank you for visiting my website! If you're interested in geomatics, want to collaborate, or just want to say hi, feel free to reach out!<p>
